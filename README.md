# Saunders
Adds functionality to linear regression graphing functions in ggplot. Named after Professor Garrett Saunders

## TODO

- Change function to geom_transform
- have the se = FALSE language
- Match the transformation to boxCox
  - In other words, allow a number, such as 0.5
- rename lm argument to model
- allow more terms / more complex models
